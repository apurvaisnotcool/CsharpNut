/*
Logical Operators:

utilize the power of AND,OR, NOT operators to create complex conditions.
XOR means NOT.OR


AND:Combines two conditions and evaluate to true if and only if both are true
OR: Combines two conditions and evaluates to true if either one of them is true
NOT:Negets the condition and evaluating true if the orginal condition is false
    Reverses the Logical state of the Operands.Returning true if the Operand is False.Vice Versa
XOR: Holds True if only one of the operands is true

bool datatype is the type of datatype that can store the value that is either true or false
